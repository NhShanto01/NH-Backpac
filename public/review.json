He does a great job of holding all the different items I need Including an iPad and avionics headphones. If I could change anything about it it would be to add magnets to the top flap like I have on my TacSac. Other than that, this is a great sac!\r\n"

The internal pouch for your laptop does not extend all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you basically get additional storage area at the bottom of the bag while still being able to retrieve your electronics. I use my Man-Bag Damnit inside of the rucksac as a case for miscellaneous things. Great combination.\r\n"

The quality of the bag is amazing, it looks even better, holds everything I need including a 26 oz YETI, admin pouch is a must to fully utilize this bag, but other than that outstanding product and led me to fall in love with many other nutsacs- admin pouch, MBD, wallet, Dopp kit, and the duffle.\r\n"
